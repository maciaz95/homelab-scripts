## Monitoring scripts

### system_health.sh
Basic script that diplays info about:
- System uptime (uptime)
- Disk usage (df -h)
- Memory usage (free -h)
- Top processes by CPU (ps aux --sort=-%cpu | (optionally head -6))
- Network connections (ss -tuln | (optionally) head -10))
- System load (cat /proc/loadavg)

**Usage:**
```bash
cd scripts/monitoring
./system_health.sh
```

## Automation scripts

### disk_space_alert.sh
Monitors disk space usage and alerts when threshold is exceeded.
- Default threshold: 80%
- Checks root partition (/)
- Shows current usage and available space (df -h, awk, sed)
- If disk usage is greater then threshold it alerts the current user (simple if statement)


**Usage:**
```bash
cd scripts/automation
./disk_space_alert.sh
```

## Security scripts

### failedSSH_loginAttempts.sh (still debugging)
Checks for failed login attempts via SSH
- Checks current date (works)
- Analyzes /var/log/auth.log file and passes the output to temporary report file
- Checks for today's failed SSH attempts (still debugging)
- Alerts if login attempts exceeded 3 (still debugging)
- Displays raport (kinda works)



**Usage:**
```bash
cd scripts/security
./failedSSH_loginAttempts.sh
```
